# Eclipse SDV Blueprints

A collaborative initiative led by Eclipse SDV members to bring the "software defined vehicle" concepts to life. A crucial aspect of each blueprint is to ensure users can easily reproduce it on their own. This requires well-written and highly clear documentation. Users can utilize blueprints as they are, for inspiration or as a foundation to customize and meet their specific needs.

## What are some of the blueprints?
Eclipse SDV Blueprints project hosts a collection of blueprints. Each blueprint has its own repository.  

| Blueprint  	|  Repository	|   Description	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Fleet Management  	| [fleet-management](https://github.com/eclipse-sdv-blueprints/fleet-management) | A close to real-life showcase for truck fleet management where trucks run an SDV software stack so that logistics fleet operators can manage apps, data and services for a diverse set of vehicles.	|

## New blueprints
If you want to propose a new blueprint, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/eclipse-sdv-blueprints/blueprints/issues)  with the blueprint repository to get started .New blueprints will be added to the SDV Blueprints project using a lightweight process. It's up to the SDV Blueprints project and/or SDV working group to decide on the incoming criteria. Please read the  [process for creation of new blueprints](https://github.com/eclipse-sdv-blueprints/blueprints).
